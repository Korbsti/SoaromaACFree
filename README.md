# SoaromaSAC — My First Real Project

SoaromaSAC (Soaroma Simple Anti-Cheat) is an anti-cheat plugin for Minecraft servers built using the Spigot/Bukkit API. Its purpose is to detect and prevent various forms of cheating, including speed hacks, flight, and more.

## Background

This was my **first-ever real programming project**, originally built when I was around **13–16 years old**. At the time, I was learning Java and programming from scratch — completely self-taught, no mentors, no team, just raw experimentation and curiosity.

Over the years, I made improvements, but the base design remained largely the same. Eventually, it got too large (and too tangled) to realistically refactor without a full rewrite.

The version you're seeing here was **re-uploaded in 2021** (the original repo was deleted and recreated) after the SpigotMC plugin page was taken down — mostly because I was a little too in love with obfuscation back then (rookie mistake).

## Why This Matters

Despite its flaws and lack of clean architecture, this project:
- Handled **real-time movement analysis** in live multiplayer environments
- Was downloaded and used by actual Minecraft server communities
- Taught me the foundations of **event-driven programming**, **threshold logic**, and **system design under constraints**

It’s far from perfect, and today I’d approach this very differently — but I’ve kept it public as a snapshot of where I started and how far I’ve come.
